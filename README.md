# DelegateCall Project

This project demonstrates a delegateCall use case. 
A delegateCall() is a method in solidity used to call a function in a target contract from an original contract. Context is passed to taret contract, but the varaiables in the original contract get modified.

This project has a sample contract wriiten in solidity, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
